Hiking is a pastime enjoyed by people all over the world. It brings relaxation and appreciation for the beauty of a screenless world. Furthermore, hiking is an affordable activity that can be enjoyed by everyone- all you need is a good pair of boots!
\
\
Unfortunately, hiking is not always accessible. For the elderly, younger children, or people with disabilities that require equipment such as canes, longer hikes with steeper elevations can be a barrier to enjoying the peace and beauty of nature.
There are a wealth of reasons for families in particular to want to take advantage of hiking trails. For example, outdoor exercise is important for children’s health and growth, and stepping over the tree roots or climbing over the rocks present in a hiking trail will help develop their balance and agility. 
\
\
	Hiking is also a chance to observe all kinds of wildlife, which is particularly important for children that live in more urban areas. Similarly, a hiking trail is a good place for parents to teach their children to respect the environment and the animals within it. Jessica Culverhouse, of the National Parks and Recreation Department, emphasises the importance of families taking “a break from [their] devices and [connecting] with each other and the outdoors… instead”.
Because we want everyone to be able to enjoy the trails at Macleish, we have designed a trail system that can be complimented with a simple implementation.
\
\
All that is required is one sign per path at Macleish, to be placed at the start of a trail and at intersections, and inscribed with the path's rating in terms of elevation and length. This sign could be affixed to a tree, or attached to a post and driven into the ground. ~13 custom aluminum signs, each three feet wide and two feet high, could be made for as little as 560 dollars - or Macleish could make its own out of wood and paint for a cheaper option. The length and elevation change will be posted on each sign in meters, with a final rating based on difficulty.
\
\
This implementation is hardly an environmental issue at all. Setting up signs is a task that does not require any harm to the environment. However, it is necessary to use materials that can last a reasonably long time, so that use of these signs become an official part of Macleish's grounds. Though creating signs is easy, a roadblock that may be an issue is that it is very hard to distinguish trails even with signs. It is possible that signs may not completely make trails at Macleish accessible because of the lack of obvious trail routes. Fortunately, it is a first easy step that Smith students can do to help Macleish feel more inclusive and accessible for all kinds of people. Below is a trail system that compliments this implementation and may make exploring Macleish more convenient for those already within Macleish grounds:

**Map Information:**
\
Trails that are currently available for viewing (and separated by color) are Vernal Pool Loop (blue), Western Loop (green), Porcupine Trail (red), Poplar Hill Road (brown), Snowmobile Trail (grey), and Eastern Loop (purple). Each trail has its own unique characteristics, so we decided to implement an "intersections" filter that brought into attention the changes. This allows hikers of all types (whether beginners, families, elders, etc) to have a sense of what is accessible to them based on a trail's conditions. 
\
\
Characteristics of each trail is presented in a table that is available for viewing by clicking on the trail of interest. Within each table, there is information on the trail's name, the total length (in meters), the starting and ending altitude (in meters), and the change in altitude (+/- meters). To reference altitude in terms of elevation within Macleish, there is a filter visual that is called "elevation". The corresponding filter "High/Low Points" can help hikers visualize how the trails change in terrain as they explore different parts of it. 
\
\
The trail system also differentiates the trails by "Easy Trails", "Moderate Trails", and "Difficult Trails". Here, hikers are able to choose trails seemlessly instead of figuring out which trails could be the easier or more difficult trails. Other filters include a "Driveway" and "Trail Kiosk" so that hikers can identify where they are in relation to all the trails in Macleish (also, it's always important to show where trails kiosks are so that hikers can get a sense of which direction they should go in relation to where they are). There is also an "Exit/Shortcuts" filter for those risk takers who decide to tackle the more challenging trails but still want to know where the easy way out is.
